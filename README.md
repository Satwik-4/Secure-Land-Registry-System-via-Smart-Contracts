## Introduction

Blockchain is a decentralized and highly secure digital ledger system that enables tamper-proof and transparent data recording and management. It allows multiple parties to access and update the same ledger simultaneously without the need for a central authority. This project addresses pressing challenges within India's land registry system by harnessing the transformative capabilities of blockchain technology, renowned for its security and transparency.

## Project Overview

The current land registration process in India is lengthy, cumbersome, and susceptible to fraud and disputes. This project proposes a blockchain-based land registry system that uses NFTs and smart contracts to:

- Improve efficiency, security, and transparency in land ownership and transactions.
- Provide a decentralized and tamper-proof registry accessible and updatable by authorized parties.
- Prevent unauthorized access, modification, and duplication of records.

## Components

The proposed system consists of two main components:

1. **Land_Registry.sol Smart Contract**: This acts as a database containing information about various lands, including ownership, boundaries, and legal status. Each land parcel is represented by a unique NFT.

2. **Land_Manager.sol Smart Contract**: This is highly regulated by the government to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. It facilitates the buying, selling, and transferring of land represented by NFTs.

## Benefits

The proposed system offers several potential benefits, including:

- Faster and more efficient land registration and transfer processes.
- Reduced risk of fraud and errors.
- Increased transparency and accountability.
- Improved access to land for marginalized communities.

## Challenges

Building and implementing the system may pose technical, regulatory, and social challenges. These include:

- Ensuring the scalability and security of the blockchain platform.
- Addressing data privacy and ownership concerns.
- Satisfying the requirements and concerns of various stakeholders, such as government agencies, landowners, and the general public.

## Research and Publications

This project's significance has led to the development of research and publications. A research paper has been submitted to THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING AND BLOCKCHAIN FOR SMART SOCIETY (MLBSS-2024).
